			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
				<p>Welcome to the <strong>Word Guess Game</strong>! This game mimics the famous <em>Hangman</em> game (minus the hangman image).</p> 
				<p>The theme for this game is <strong>colours of the rainbow</strong>! There are 7 colours of the rainbow, but this game only reveals 3 rainbow colours, so which colour word would appear? Only one way to find out! Play the game!</p>

				<p><em>Please read the instructions below to learn how to play the game</em>.</p>
				
				<h3>Instructions</h3>
					<ol>
						<li>Press any key to start the game</li>
						<li>Press a letter on your keyboard (note: only lowercase letters allowed) to begin guessing the word</li>
							<ul>
								<li>If the letter is contained in the word, the letter will appear; otherwise, you will have to try again. You are allowed multiple tries.</li>
								<li>Once all the letters of the word have appeared, you have won the game and will receive a score of 1.</li>
							</ul>
						<li>Click the <em>Play again</em> button to start a new game.</li>
					</ol>

				<p>Enjoy the game!</p>
